[PHP](https://www.php.net/) plugin for the [asdf version manager](https://asdf-vm.com/) or [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/); uses [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for PHP installation instead of compiling PHP.

</div>

Throughout the use of this documentation, whenever `asdf` as a command is used, `mise` should work as well.
